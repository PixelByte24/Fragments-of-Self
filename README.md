# ðŸ§© Fragments of Self

**Fragments of Self** is a 2D puzzle-platformer built in **Godot 4.2+**, where you explore a crumbling inner world by shifting between three aspects of yourself: **Body**, **Mind**, and **Soul**. Each mode unlocks unique interactions â€” pushing, jumping, or attacking â€” that help you traverse forgotten memories and unlock your fragmented identity.

## ðŸŽ® Gameplay

- **Body Mode** â€“ Push heavy blocks to solve physical puzzles.
- **Mind Mode** â€“ Agile and light; double jump to reach higher places.
- **Soul Mode** â€“ Attack to dispel shadow creatures and corrupted thoughts.

Each level represents a symbolic memory space â€” from forgotten libraries to overgrown gardens â€” designed to be moody, atmospheric, and meaningful.
